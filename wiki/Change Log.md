| **Version** | **Date** | **Change log** |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0.6.0 | 10.08.2017 | • Add<br>- Made new panel menu align better. i think i will run over all panels and make them more compact.<br>  The new panel design have items grouped better together. Makes more it view much easier.<br>
| 0.5.9 | 10.08.2017 | • Add<br>-Added a fix for channels, When engine presets menu is active all channels need to be available even if they are not supported.<br> This will however let the user think all channels can be used. Only fix would to some how import the presets into thea4blender. This is very hard to do i think, there most be tons of rules written to extract all the data from the custom render presets. I think its not really doable.<br>Best thing to do is to add a info panel to channels which shows when render preset is active.<br>
| 0.5.9 | 10.08.2017 | • Fix<br>- Fixed Ortho view in all possibilities, also all sensor height and widths.<br>- Fixed missing channel names when channels are saved.<br>- Fixed missing line breaks in bottom part of thea_exporter.py.<br><br>• Add<br>- Big Render previews. Also uses shortcut alt + shift B, Needs one fix. When material is done rendering it doesn’t update until window is resized. So it needs to be close or click outside and then reopen.<br>- Added links to documentation and forum in Addons panel preferences.<br>- Added region render, scene will be exported to Studio like export_frame does. Also added option there to render it in Darkroom mode only (so no GUI, saves more memory).<br>- Adjusted image saving, now saves scene name without XML extension. Wasn’t needed and added a period middle in the name.<br>- Made new design for panel. They where to much panels, how is saw it, so i merged render & export, engines settings, ir settings and channels.<br> I added all IR settings to main settings tab, channels is a tab and render & export is a tab.<br>- Added region render to engine settings. Was only visible when thea remote setup was visible, yet this is for thea4blender port numbers for darkroom app.<br>
| 0.5.8 | 24.07.2017 | • Fix<br>- My fix version for Ortho view when using IR, this fix does check if sensor_height is vertical, horizontal or auto.<br>
| 0.5.7 | 19.07.2017 | • Add<br>- Added a new function for IBL lighting, user can pick color for IBL and is converted to image.<br>  This color is converted to a image and updates live.<br>  When its turned off, the old HDR (need to add more types) is put back then.<br>- User can copy paste this generated image to other slots.<br>- Still need to find a way to do this with all IBL maps but not redo the code.<br>
| 0.5.6 | 18.07.2017 | • Fix<br>- Returned texture input color, when only texture is visible it doesn’t say what it is. Making exceptions for this is possible but draw menu will get very long.<br>- AO settings missing IR render (Added AO to presto).<br>- Fixed IR menu and rearranged items.<br>- Soft Shadow need standard to be on.<br>- When using locations, sun must be hidden (sun is generated automatically by “GenerateSun”).<br>- Fix for Sky only.<br>- Fixed location search, no more false input. But Land names are gone now.<br>- Updates for sun and sky are not in sync, only engine type updates with IR, no other setting updates.<br>- Fixed by using correct locations method and GenerateSun is placed after root.<br>- Polar Angle and Azimur Angle are managed by GenerateSun, this makes locations work properly now and updates correctly.<br>- Edited locations menu, fixed titlecasing issues.<br>- Fixed Latitude & Longitude error when to much space in txt file.<br>- Sky type > was missing sky can also be rendered without sun.<br><br>• Add<br>- Search function for locations.<br>- More locations. Also expanded the number of line from 300 > 1200.<br>- Model movement, theaSync tools menu.<br>- Emittance Unit and attenuation, difference spot and sun, theaSync tools menu.<br>- Locations to XML exported.<br>
| 0.5.5 | 14.07.2017 | • Fix<br>- Added missing Roughness TR texture input for Glossy, GLossy2 and SSS.<br>- Fix small typo in code.<br>
| 0.5.4 | 13.07.2017 | • Fix<br>- Fixed Parallel preview in Blender, Thea doesn’t support shift X or Y, so it turnes off now.<br>- Fix for when 2 layers and coating was active, if the second layer had a weight map, this got transferred to the coating layer. <br>- Fixed mesh export when solidify mod is on, modifier get earlier applied. Did some test and difference didn’t look that much different (perhaps you should check it as well). <br>- Fixed a error when Material Preview for LUT materials was working (thea_render_main># 4176). <br>- Fixed IES lamp > Doesn’t have Attenuation. <br>- Fixed SPOT as its, was error in the code. <br>- Fixed when more than 1 sun is in scene, got exported as lamp. Now more suns can be exported. <br>- Fixed IBL Type > was added to all IBL maps, only needs to be applied to Image Based Lighting (Thea_exporter>#1851).<br>- Minimised all input by taking away Color or texture input, its quite clear if its a color or texture input.<br><br>• Add<br>- Updated "Sync with Thea", all camera settings, lamp, sun settings get synced now as well.<br>- Updated layout Camera Panel, added items like; focal width and height, camera preview method (Spherical or Ortho), Added better check when items or on and which should be off.<br>- Updated Material Panel when IOR file is checked, all other items like; color, reflection, absorption, abbe get inactive now.<br>- Added Search button for IOR file, list is to long and goes beyond screen, now you can quickly search the dropdownmenu.<br>- Added Search button for LUT mat library, list is to long and goes beyond screen, now you can quickly search the dropdownmenu.<br>- Added option to choose export or frame folder for image save location. Thea4Blender always saves 2 images, 1 in export folder and 1 in frame folder. When doing a animation this takes a lot of unneeded time.<br>- Added more precise numbers for F-Number (aperture) and DOF distance. Needed to be more precise.<br>
